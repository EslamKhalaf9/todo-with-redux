# Todo List using Reactjs with and without Redux

I have built a reactjs simple Todo List.

This application can do :
[x] Add todo
[x] Mark todo as Done
[x] Remove todo from todo list (available on redux version only)
[x] Mark all todos as done (available on redux version only)
[x] Remove all todos
